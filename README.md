## 👋 Hi, I'm Jasper Ang (@jasper-ang)
I'm a full-stack developer working on AI projects. I focus on the application and ultility area while the smart people at Deepmind 

Right now, I'm building a journaling app that tries to “remember” conversations and keep context over time, so it feels like a real chat buddy.
https://journal-app-two-pi.vercel.app/ < Haven't come out with a proper branding yet, the product is still in beta testing

### 👀 Interests
- **LLM Application Layer:** I create tools that use large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT to make more interactive apps.
- **Multimodal Systems:** Mixing different kinds of inputs—like text, images, and sound—to make AI more versatile.
- **Contextual Memory:** Working on ways for AI to remember information across different interactions, so it can connect past conversations.

### 🌱 Currently Learning
- **Letta MemGPT:** I’m figuring out how to use memory-based GPTs to keep track of long conversations.
- **Prompt Orchestration:** Creating better prompts (questions or instructions for AI) to keep interactions smooth and meaningful.
- **Memory Persistant tradeoffs:**: Still figuring out the balance between caching vectors, saving into db, when to do what

### 💞️ Open to Collaborate On
- **Multimodal AI Projects:** Projects that combine multiple input types to make AI “smarter.”
- **LLM Apps:** Building apps that use language models, especially ones that need clever prompts to work well.
- **Memory Systems:** Collaborating on AI projects that need ways to keep memory across sessions.
