###  Hello! üëã I'm Jasper 

---

I'm a full-stack developer working on ulitity focused AI projects. 

I focus on building the application and ultility area while the smart people at Deepmind, BAIR and CSAIL figure out AGI, cause you know, someone‚Äôs gotta handle the easy stuff. üòÜ

Right now, I'm building a journaling app that tries to ‚Äúremember‚Äù conversations and keep context over time, so it feels like a real chat buddy.

[**Journal App (Beta)**](https://journal-app-two-pi.vercel.app/) ‚Äî Still working on the branding, and it's currently in beta, so feel free to test it out!
