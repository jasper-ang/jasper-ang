## 👋 Hi, I'm Jasper (@jasper-ang)
I'm a full-stack developer working on AI projects. 

I focus on the application and ultility area while the smart people at Deepmind, BAIR and CSAIL figure out AGI, cause you know, someone’s gotta handle the easy stuff. 😆

Right now, I'm building a journaling app that tries to “remember” conversations and keep context over time, so it feels like a real chat buddy.

### 👀 Interests
- **LLM Application Layer:** Creating tools with large language models (LLMs) to build more interactive apps.
- **Multimodal Systems:** Mixing different kinds of inputs—like text, images, and sound—to make AI more versatile.
- **Contextual Memory:** Working on ways for AI to remember information across different interactions, so it can connect past conversations.

### 🌱 Currently Learning
- **Letta MemGPT:** I’m figuring out how to use memory-based GPTs to keep track of long conversations.
- **Prompt Orchestration:** Creating better prompts (questions or instructions for AI) to keep interactions smooth and meaningful.
- **Memory Persistant tradeoffs:**: Balancing when to save data in the database or cache it for speed.

### 💞️ Open to Collaborate On
- **Multimodal AI Projects:** Projects that combine multiple input types to make AI “smarter.”
- **LLM Apps:** Building apps that use language models, especially ones that need clever prompts to work well.
- **Memory Systems:** Collaborating on AI projects that need ways to keep memory across sessions.
